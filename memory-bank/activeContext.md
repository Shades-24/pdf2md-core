# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Image processing improvements
- Web interface implementation
- LaTeX and footnote support
- Heading structure refinement

## Recent Changes
1. Image Processing:
   - Added smart image type detection
   - Implemented context-aware quality settings
   - Added WebP compression with type-specific optimization
   - Added support for diagrams, photos, and icons

2. Web Interface:
   - Created modern UI with Tailwind CSS
   - Added drag-and-drop file upload
   - Implemented real-time preview
   - Added download and copy options
   - Added error handling and loading states

3. Document Structure:
   - Added font size-based heading detection
   - Implemented proper heading hierarchy
   - Added table of contents generation
   - Added footnote support
   - Added LaTeX equation handling

## Active Decisions
1. Image Strategy:
   - Use WebP for optimal compression
   - Context-aware quality settings
   - Separate handling for diagrams, photos, icons
   - Position-aware placement

2. Web Interface Strategy:
   - Modern, responsive design
   - Real-time feedback
   - Error handling and validation
   - Progress indication
   - Live preview

3. Document Structure:
   - Font size-based heading detection
   - Pattern-based heading recognition
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Footnote reference linking
   - LaTeX equation preservation

## Implementation Notes
- Image processing working well with type detection
- Web interface provides good user experience
- Heading structure properly maintained
- Footnotes and LaTeX properly handled
- Need to monitor image processing warnings

## Current Priorities
1. Monitor and improve image processing
2. Enhance error handling
3. Optimize performance
4. Improve user feedback

## Technical Considerations
- Image type analysis needs refinement
- Error handling in web interface
- LaTeX equation formatting
- Document structure preservation
