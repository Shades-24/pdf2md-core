# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Image extraction and processing improvements
- Text formatting and layout enhancements
- Web interface stability

## Recent Decisions
1. Simplified image extraction approach:
   - Using direct page rendering with high DPI
   - Focusing on image blocks rather than embedded images
   - Adding padding to ensure complete image capture
   - Proper temporary file handling

2. Text processing improvements:
   - Better paragraph detection
   - Improved heading spacing
   - Multi-column text support
   - Enhanced block positioning

3. Image optimization strategy:
   - Higher initial DPI (300) for better quality
   - Proper RGB conversion for all image types
   - Size-based optimization with aspect ratio preservation
   - PNG format for better quality/size balance

## Active Considerations
1. Image Quality vs Performance:
   - Using higher DPI for initial capture
   - Implementing smart resizing based on content type
   - Balancing quality with file size
   - Proper cleanup of temporary files

2. Text Layout:
   - Multi-column detection and handling
   - Proper spacing between elements
   - Maintaining document structure
   - Position-aware image placement

3. Error Handling:
   - Graceful fallback for failed image extractions
   - Clear error messages for debugging
   - Proper cleanup in error cases
   - User-friendly error reporting

## Implementation Notes
- Using PyMuPDF's pixmap functionality for reliable image extraction
- Temporary file management for image processing
- Base64 encoding for web display
- Proper cleanup of resources

## Current Challenges
1. Complex PDF Handling:
   - Some PDFs may have unusual image formats
   - Multi-column layout detection accuracy
   - Image quality in scanned documents

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Large PDF processing time
   - Memory usage during image processing
   - Temporary file management

## Next Actions
1. Testing:
   - Verify improvements with various PDF types
   - Test multi-column handling
   - Validate image quality and positioning

2. Enhancements:
   - Add progress indicators
   - Improve error reporting
   - Consider custom optimization settings
   - Add more user feedback in web interface
