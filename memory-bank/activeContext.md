# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Small image validation
- Footnote handling
- LaTeX support implementation

## Recent Changes
1. Gap-Based Positioning:
   - Successfully implemented
   - Working for most images
   - Preserves document flow
   - Handles text wrapping

2. Text Processing:
   - Block-level extraction working
   - Proper formatting preserved
   - Content order maintained
   - Spacing handled correctly

3. Image Processing:
   - WebP compression effective
   - Base64 encoding stable
   - Position detection improved
   - Gap analysis working

## Active Decisions
1. Small Image Strategy:
   - Need relative size checks
   - Context-based validation
   - Inline image detection
   - Icon/symbol handling

2. Footnote Strategy:
   - Detect by position
   - Preserve numbering
   - Maintain links
   - Special formatting

3. LaTeX Strategy:
   - Identify equations
   - Convert to markdown
   - Preserve formatting
   - Handle special symbols

## Implementation Notes
- Gap-based approach working well
- Need to save current version
- Small images need refinement
- Footnotes and LaTeX next focus

## Current Priorities
1. Implement small image validation
2. Develop footnote detection
3. Add LaTeX support
4. Maintain current functionality

## Technical Considerations
- Image type analysis
- Position patterns
- Mathematical notation
- Document structure
